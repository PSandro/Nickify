# Nickify

Nickify is a spigot plugin for Minecraft servers that allows to change and manage a player's nametag.

# Features

  - Change minecraft username and skin
  - Change and set Nametag prefix and suffix

As this plugin works with ProtocolLib's PacketContainers, the changes can be sent to a individual collection of players. For example: if a player types /nick, normal players but staff would see the fake name then.

# TODO
  - implement UI
  - add API + documentation
